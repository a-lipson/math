  Let $f: hat(CC) -> hat(CC)$ be a continuous map where $hat(CC)$ is the Reimann sphere.

  We say that $f$ is holomorphic at $a$ if either:
  - $a != oo, f(a) != oo$, and $f$ is holomorphic at $a$ in the usual sense;
  - $a != oo, f(a) = oo$, and $z mapsto 1 \/ (f(z))$ is holomorphic as $a$;
  - $a = oo, f(a) != oo$, and $z mapsto f(1\/z)$ is holomorphic at 0;
  - $a = oo, f(a) = oo$, and $z mapsto 1\/f(1\/z)$ is holomorphic at 0.

  We say that $f$ is biholomorphic if it is holomorphic and has a holomorphic inverse.

  + Check that nonconstant holomorphic functions $hat(CC)->hat(CC)$ may be identified with nonconstant meromorphic functions $hat(CC)->CC$ and are hence rational functions.

  + Prove that any biholomorphic map $f:hat(CC)->hat(CC)$ has the form $f(z)= (a z+b) / (c z + d)$ where $a,b,c,d in CC$, with $a d - b c != 0$.
