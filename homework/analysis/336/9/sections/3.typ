  Let $Omega subset CC$ be a region and suppose that ${f_n}_(n in NN)$ is a sequence of holomorphic functions that is uniformly bounded on compact subsets of $Omega$.

  Let $f$ be a holomorphic function on $Omega$, and let $S := {z in Omega | lim_(n -> oo) f_n(z) = f(z)}$.

  Prove that if $S$ has a limit point in $Omega$, then $f_n â†’ f$ uniformly on compact subsets of $Omega$.
