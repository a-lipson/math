#heading(numbering: none)[Abstract]

In this project, we plan to introduce the curious prospective mathematician to some introductory ideas in combinatorics.
In particular, we will discuss recurrence relations, generating functions, and integer partitions.

For our peers, we will expand on these ideas and wield some of our analysis tools developed in 336 to demonstrate a proof of the Hardy-Ramanujan estimation formula for partitions.
