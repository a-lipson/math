#heading(numbering: none)[Abstract]

In this project, we plan to introduce the curious prospective mathematician to some introductory ideas in combinatorics.
In particular, we will discuss recurrence relations, generating functions, and integer partitions.

For our peers, we will expand on these ideas and wield some of our analysis tools developed in 336 to introduce the circle method, a tool employed in proof of the Hardy-Ramanujan estimation formula for partitions.

The paper is organized into three sections:

#set enum(numbering: "1.", indent: 0em, spacing: 1em)

1. The first section describes the student activities associated with the project, including the materials required for the physical interactive activity and guiding questions for students to ponder when working with the materials.
2. The second section acts as a primer for prospective students on combinatorics.
3. The third section provides a detailed explanation of the ideas at a deeper level for peers in 336.
